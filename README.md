# Alzheimer Disease Prediction — Machine Learning Project

This project aims to predict whether a patient is affected by Alzheimer’s disease
using clinical, cognitive, and lifestyle variables.

## Project structure
- `Projet_Alzheimer.ipynb` : complete data preprocessing, modeling and evaluation pipeline

## Main steps
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering and encoding
- Exploratory data analysis
- Baseline and advanced models
- Feature importance analysis
- Model comparison and final selection

## Tools
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Goal
Support early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease by maximizing recall on positive cases.
